# Pathfinder-MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Pathfinder 2e data from the Archives of Nethys (AON). This tool enables AI assistants like Claude to access and provide accurate information about Pathfinder 2e rules, spells, feats, and more.

## Features

- üîç Search for Pathfinder 2e content across 21 categories including spells, feats, classes, and more
- üìö Retrieve detailed information about specific game elements
- üéØ Get complete lists of items within categories
- ‚ö° Optimized search with intelligent query handling
- üß† Designed for use with MCP-compatible AI assistants

## How It Works

Pathfinder-MCP provides a standardized MCP interface between AI assistants and the Pathfinder 2e Archives of Nethys data. It offers three main tools:

1. **searchPathfinder** - Search within a specific category using a query string
2. **getPathfinderItem** - Get detailed information about a specific item by name and category
3. **getAllPathfinderItems** - List all items in a category with pagination support

The server connects to the Archives of Nethys Elasticsearch instance to provide up-to-date game information.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HeatherFlux/Pathfinder-MCP.git
   cd Pathfinder-MCP
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   # or
   pnpm build
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the MCP server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

This will start the server using stdio transport, making it compatible with MCP-enabled applications.

### Using with Claude

Claude can interact with the Pathfinder-MCP server to provide accurate Pathfinder 2e information:

1. Configure Claude Desktop to use the Pathfinder-MCP server:
   - Open Claude Desktop settings
   - Go to the MCP section
   - Add a new server configuration for Pathfinder-MCP

2. Once configured, you can ask Claude about Pathfinder 2e content, such as:
   - "Tell me about the Fireball spell in Pathfinder 2e"
   - "What are the abilities of the Fighter class?"
   - "Explain the Power Attack feat"

Claude will use the MCP server to retrieve accurate information from the Archives of Nethys.

searchPathfinder({ category: "class", query: "fighter" })
```

### Getting specific items

getPathfinderItem({ category: "feat", name: "Power Attack" })

// Get information about the Fighter class
getPathfinderItem({ category: "class", name: "Fighter" })
```

### Listing items in a category

getAllPathfinderItems({ category: "spell" })

// Get 10 feats, starting from the 20th feat
getAllPathfinderItems({ category: "feat", limit: 10, offset: 20 })
```
