# Run Tests Before Completing Tasks

Always run tests and linters before completing a task to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Testing Requirements
1. Run `npm test` to execute all unit tests
2. Run `npm run lint` to check for code style issues
3. Fix any failing tests or linting errors before submitting changes

## Benefits
- Catches bugs early in the development process
- Ensures consistent code quality
- Prevents breaking changes from being introduced
- Maintains project stability
